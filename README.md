# 🩺 CT Scan Disease Prediction using AI

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting diseases using CT Scan images with the help of **AI/ML techniques**.  
We used the **LandingAI platform** to train, validate, and test the model.  

The system classifies CT Scan images into **disease / no disease categories** based on trained features.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LandingAI**
- **Machine Learning / Deep Learning**
- **Jupyter Notebook (for preprocessing & analysis)**
- **OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas**

---

## 📂 Dataset
- A labeled dataset of **CT Scan images** was used.  
- Images were uploaded to **LandingAI** for training and testing.  

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Gathered CT Scan images dataset.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Resized & cleaned dataset.  
3. **Model Training** – Used **LandingAI** to train on dataset.  
4. **Evaluation** – Tested accuracy & generated confusion matrix.  
5. **Deployment** – Model accessible via QR code.
